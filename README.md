# sustainabiity_energy_analysis
This is my analysis on sustainability energy metrics involving , segmentation, predictive modelling , comparative analysis and creating hypothetical scenarios as well.

I created a dummy data for the year 2023 for my analysis with fetaures such as;
- Electricity_Usage_kWh: Electricity usage in kWh.
- Gas_Usage_kWh: Gas usage in kWh.
- Renewable_Usage_kWh: Renewable energy usage in kWh.
- CO2_Emissions_Tons: CO2 emissions in tons.
- Waste_Generated_Tons: Total waste generated in tons.
- Waste_Recycled_Tons: Waste recycled in tons.
- Waste_Composted_Tons: Waste composted in tons.
- Waste_Landfilled_Tons: Waste landfilled in tons.
- Units_Produced: Units of product manufactured.
- Energy_Efficiency: Units produced per total energy usage.
- Waste_to_Recycling_Ratio: Ratio of waste recycled to waste generated.
- Emissions_per_Unit: Emissions per unit of production.
  
These are the list of tasks i perormed to achieve the overall sustainability metrics goal;
- Descriptive Analysis: i generated averages and summaries of each features 
- Correlation Analysis: Assess relationships between variables
- KPI Tracking: Tracked sustainability by calculating efficiency metrics
- Predictive Analysis: Forecasted  future metrics using PROPHET 
- Comparative Analysis: Identified differences across data segment like thewaste types 
- Scenario Analysis: Simulated hypothetical changes by adjusting weights of effieciency metrics
- Dashboard Visualization: Created  visuals for monitoring sustainability  goals.
